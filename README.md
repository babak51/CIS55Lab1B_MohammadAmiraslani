Write a simple program in Swift that will calculate a person's daily and total pay over a month, 
store each day's pay in one array and the total in a second array and print out details.
1. Define one Integer array that will hold the daily pay and second integer array to hold the 
calculated total pay up to any given day.  It is required to have two arrays, even though it could
be done through calculations on the fly.

2. Define an integer variable which will store the value for number of days of pay the pgm will calculate.

3. The first day's pay will be 1 cent, second day's pay 2 cents and will double every day.

4. You will write a loop to initialize the elements of your daily pay array on a daily basis.

5. You will also define a variable to calculate the total pay from day 1 for each day and store it in the 
second array in the same loop.

6. You will print out the daily and total pay earned for every day in columnnar format, i.e. one row per
day, 3 columns per row for day #, day'spay, total pay.

7. While you will store the data as cents in the array, when printing you will print corresponding dollar
values in #5.
